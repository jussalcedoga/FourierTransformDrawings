# FourierTransformDrawings

This repo is intended to show how the Fourier Series works to fit a cuadratic signal by adding more and more terms which can be controled by using the slider in the *Fourier_Series/index.html* file. In the Fourier Transform folder, you will find an algorithm which draws any given arbitrary function. There are two methods for finding this function. One is by entering into a website and define the function by your own clicks. The other one, is by using an edge detection algorithm and a clockwise sorting procedure applied to the coordinates of the found edges of a given image. However, the later procedure is restricted to very simple shapes which can be sorted clockwise with respect to a single center without distorting the draw. You can see the "Drawing Machine" in action by opening the *Fourier_Transform/index_html* file inside the in your preferred web browser.
